# ScannerStoryBoard
The Structure sample program that uses Storyboard instead of XIB files

I modified it to use NSLogger, you can get the destop monitoring app here: https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger

The Structure 3D scanner is avaialable at: http://structure.io

You will need a copy of the Structure SDK in order to get the Structure.framework
